# Hi there!
<p align="justify">
  Making games since 2019, being made by games since 2001. Synergizing with gameplay programming across the engine trifecta, also known as Unreal, Unity and Godot, along with their respective development languages. 
  Occasionally also dabble in other facets of game development such as game design, game animation, as well as other terms that start with "game".
